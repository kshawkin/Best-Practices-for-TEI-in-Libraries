          <p>To create a stand-alone electronic text and identify
          hierarchy (logical structure) and typography without content
          analysis being of primary importance.</p>
        </div>

          <head>Rationale</head>
          <p>Encoding at this level provides the foundation for
          upgrading to higher levels of encoding. Level 3 generally
          requires some human editing, but the features to be encoded
          are determined by the logical structure and appearance of
          the text and not specialized content analysis.</p>
          <p>Level 3 texts identify front and back matter, textual
          divisions, and all paragraph breaks. Floating texts, or
          sub-texts like a poem or letter embedded in the greater
          text, are supported in this level. The finer granularity of
          encoding these features, as well as figures, notes, and all
          changes of typography, allows a range of options for
          display, delivery, and searching. For example, one has the
          option of identifying, and therefore specifying, the display
          characteristics of different typographic styles, and
          regularizing the display and placement of note text.</p>
          <p>Level 3 texts can stand alone as text without page
          images, and therefore can be uploaded, downloaded, and
          delivered quickly, and require less storage space than
          digital collections with page images. However, the simple
          level of structural analysis and absence of specialized
          content analysis reflected in Level 3 encoding may make it
          desirable for some, depending on project priorities, to
          include page images in order to provide users with a fuller
          set of resources.</p>
          <list>
            <head>Level 3 is most suitable for projects with the following characteristics</head>
            <item>the material is of interest to a large community of users who wish to read texts that allow for keyword searching</item>
            <item>some sophistication of display, delivery, and searching based on structure of the text is desired</item>
            <item>each text will undergo quality control to ensure that encoding decisions have been made appropriately</item>
            <item>the users of the texts may have limited storage or display capabilities</item>
            <item>the creator of the texts has limited or no ability to provide content expertise to analyze, tag, or review texts</item>
            <item>extensibility is desired; that is, one desires to keep open the option for a higher level of encoding to be added at a later date</item>

          <p>Level 3 texts can be created by conversion from an
          electronic source such as an HTML file or word-processor
          document or from a print source, either through OCR or
          keyboarding. They can be generated trivially by converting
          from outsourced double-keyboarded texts
          conforming to <ref

            <p>You may wish not to include front matter content such as table of contents or lists of illustrations, especially if you plan to automatically generate the contents or lists of illustrations.  If you do, however, plan to manually encode the table of contents (or lists of illustrations and similar content), use a <gi>div</gi> (or <gi>div1</gi>) element with an appropriate <att>type</att> attribute (e.g., <tag>div type="contents"</tag>). Within this division, use the <gi>list</gi> element to mark up the table of contents, list of illustrations, etc. Each list item should have a <gi>ptr</gi> or <gi>ref</gi> element with a <att>target</att> attribute referencing an <att>xml:id</att> attribute on the <gi>pb</gi> or on the <gi>div</gi> (or <gi>div1</gi>) of the referenced page or section. Use <gi>ref</gi> if you wish to transcribe page numbers in the table of contents; use <gi>ptr</gi> if you do not.</p>
          </div>
          <div type="grec">
            <head>Notes</head>
            <p>Use the <gi>note</gi> element to encode the text of a margin note, 
	      footnote, endnote, or other note found in the source document. If a
	      point of attachment is marked with a siglumn (such as an asterisk 
	      or superscript number), encode the siglum with a <gi>ref</gi> 
	      element. Alternatively, if there is no marked point of attachment, 
	      insert a <gi>ptr</gi> at the most likely implied point of attachment
	      for the note.</p>
	    <p>The text of the note (inside a <gi>note</gi> element) may either (a) be 
	      left where it occurs in the layout of the page (as may be more 
	      convenient in the case of conversion from OCR text) or may (b) be moved
	      so that the <gi>note</gi> occurs just following the <gi>ref</gi> or 
	      <gi>ptr</gi> marking the point of attachment. If a note span pages,
	      be sure to insert a <gi>pb</gi> to mark the start of a new page. 
	      Similarly, if the note in the source document begins on a different 
	      page from the place of reference, a <gi>pb</gi> should be inserted 
	      before the first word of the note within the <gi>note</gi> to record 
	      this.</p>
	    <p>The siglum is often repeated at the beginning of the note to aid the 
	      reader in matching the siglum in the text to the note. Encode any 
	      siglum within the note using <gi>label</gi>.</p>
            <p>Here is an example encoded according to method (a)—first the sigla:
	      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
		<p>The three little pigs built their houses out of straw,<ref target="#n_a1">1</ref>

                      SHOULD BE VACATED; ALTERNATIVELY, DISCOVERY AND A HEARING SHOULD BE
                      ORDERED.</head>
                      <p>The nature and extent of surveillance of Hiss, his family and associates was
                      not known at the time of trial by the defense. Even now, with the release of
                      some of the govern­ ment documents concerning FBI investigative techniques
                      regarding Hiss, the full extent of surveillance -- wiretapping, mail open­
                      ings, mail covers, physical surveillance, and other intrusive techniques -- is
                      still not 'clear. Nevertheless, it is apparent that information gathered
                      through the exploitation of unlawful wiretaps and other illegal surveillance
                      was used at trial and consequently the conviction must be reversed.
                      Alternatively, further discovery and a hearing is essential to a fair deter­
                      mination regarding these issues.</p>
                      <p>FBI surveillance of Hiss began in earnest in 1941 with the institution of a
                      mail cover on his incoming correspondence at his home in connection with an
                      FBI investigation of possible Hatch Act violations. CN Ex. 98A. Another mail
                      cover was placed <pb n="114" facs="00000002.tif"/> on the Hiss mail in 1945,
                      and at the same time the FBI obtained toll call records from the Hiss
                      residence Telephone for the years 1943 and 1944 as well. CN Ex. 99. In
                      September, 1945, the FBI intercepted telegrams to Hiss as well. CN Ex.
                      100.</p>
                      <p>In late November, 1945, FBI surveillance of the Hiss residence in Washington,
                      D.C., escalated. For the third time, a mail cover was instituted beginning on
                      November 28, 1945, which was continued at least until 1946. CN Ex. 101 at p.
                      70; CN Ex. 102. Continuous physical surveillance of Hiss was begun as well. CN
                      Ex. 101 at p. 72. Although this twenty-four-hour surveillance was discontinued
                      on December 14, 1945, physical surveillance was conducted frequently at
		      various times until September, 1947. <ptr target="#n68">68</ptr>
		      <note place="bottom" anchored="true" xml:id="n68"><label>68</label>Also before 
		      1947, a letter from Priscilla Hiss addressed to her son,
                      Timothy Hobson, was intercepted and its contents read. CN Ex. 100A at p.
                      167. In approximately March, 1947, a letter from a Michael Greenberg
                      addressed to petitioner re­ garding an application for employment with the
                      United Nations was also intercepted, in a manner not revealed by the docu­
                      ments. CN Ex. 100B</note> CN Ex. 102; CN Ex. 103.</p>
                      <p>The most intrusive invasion of petitioner's rights <pb n="115"
                      facs="00000003.tif"/> occurred from December 13, 1945 until the Hisses moved
                      from Washington, D.C. to New York City on September 13, 1947. A "technical
                      surveillance," -- a wiretap -- was placed on the Hiss telephone at their
                      residence on P Street-in Washington, D.C. The logs of this surveillance
                      constitute twenty-nine volumes of FBI serials and are roughly 2,500 pages in
                      length, in which an enormous amount of information concerning the Hisses' per­
                      sonal lives, relationships with friends and associates, and habits is
                      recorded.</p>
                      <p>The wiretap was installed following FBI Director Hoover's application to the
		      Attorney General for authorization, <ptr target="n69">69</ptr><note place="bottom" 
		      anchored="true" xml:id="n69"><label>69</label>Hoover's initial request was answered by a note reques­ ting
                      information on Hiss. CN Ex. 104. Additional information was furnished by
                      letter dated November 30, 1945. CN Ex. 105.</note> although no written
                      authorization appears in the documents released to Hiss. The purpose of the
                      application was to gather information regarding Hiss' alleged contacts with
                      Soviet espionage agents and communists in government service, general
                      allegations which had been made by Elizabeth Bentley and Chambers.</p>

              <remarks>
                <p>Particularly where cataloguing is likely to be
                based on the content of the header, it is advisable to
                use a generally recognized name authority file to
                supply the content for this element. The attribute
                <att>ref</att> may also be used to reference canonical
                information about the author(s) intended from any
                appropriate authority, such as a library catalogue or
                online resource.</p>
                <p>In the case of a broadcast, use this element for
                the name of the company or network responsible for
                making the broadcast.</p>
                <p>Where an author is unknown or unspecified, this
                element may contain text such as
                <mentioned>Unknown</mentioned> or
