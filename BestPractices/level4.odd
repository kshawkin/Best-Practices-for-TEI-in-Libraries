      </div>
      <div type="rationale">
	<head>Rationale</head>
	<p>Encoding at this level offers provides the foundation for
	upgrading to higher levels of encoding. Level 3 generally
	requires some human editing, but the features to be encoded
	are determined by the logical structure and appearance of the
	text and not specialized content analysis.</p>
	<p>Level 3 texts identify front and back matter, divisions
	within the text, and all paragraph breaks. Floating texts, or
	sub-texts like a poem or letter embedded in the greater text,
	are supported in this level. The finer granularity of encoding
	these features, as well as figures, notes, and all changes of
	typography, allows a range of options for display, delivery,
	and searching. For example, one has the option of identifying,
	and therefore specifying, the display characteristics of
	different typographic styles, and regularizing the display and
	placement of note text.</p>
	<p>Level 3 texts can stand alone as text without page images,
	and therefore can be uploaded, downloaded, and delivered
	quickly, and require less storage space than digital
	collections with page images. However, the simple level of
	structural analysis and absence of specialized content
	analysis reflected in Level 3 encoding may make it desirable
	for some, depending on project priorities, to include page
	images in order to provide users with a fuller set of
	resources.</p>
	<list>
	  <head>Level 3 is most suitable for projects with the
	  following characteristics</head>
	  <item>the material is of interest to a large community of
	  users who wish to read texts that allow for keyword
	  searching</item>
	  <item>some sophistication of display, delivery, and
	  searching based on structure of the text is desired</item>
	  <item>each text will undergo quality control to ensure that
	  encoding decisions have been made appropriately</item>
	  <item>the users of the texts may have limited storage or
	  display capabilities</item>
	  <item>the creator of the texts has limited or no ability to
	  provide content expertise to analyze, tag, or review
	  texts</item>
	  <item>extensibility is desired; that is, one desires to keep
	  open the option for a higher level of encoding to be added
	  at a later date</item>

      <div type="workflow">
	<head>Workflow</head>
	<p>Level 3 texts can be created by conversion from an
	electronic source such as an HTML file or word-processor
	document or from a print source, either through OCR or
	keyboarding. They can be generated trivially by converting
	from outsourced double-keyboarded texts conforming to <ref
	target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-exemplars/html/tei_tite.doc.html">TEI

	    </item>
	  </list>
	  <p>You may wish not to include front matter content such as
	  table of contents or lists of illustrations, especially if
	  you plan to automatically generate the contents or lists of
	  illustrations. If you do, however, plan to manually encode
	  the table of contents (or lists of illustrations and similar
	  content), use a <gi>div</gi> element with an appropriate
	  <att>type</att> attribute (e.g., <tag>div
	  type="contents"</tag>). Within this division, use the
	  <gi>list</gi> element to mark up the table of contents, list
	  of illustrations, etc. Each list <gi>item</gi> should have a
	  <gi>ptr</gi> or <gi>ref</gi> element with a
	  <att>target</att> attribute referencing an <att>xml:id</att>
	  attribute on the <gi>pb</gi> or <gi>div</gi> element of the
	  referenced page or section. Use <gi>ref</gi> if you wish to
	  transcribe page numbers in the table of contents; use
	  <gi>ptr</gi> if you do not.</p>
	</div>
	<div type="grec">
	  <head>Notes</head>
	  <p>Use the <gi>note</gi> element to encode the text of a
	  marginal note, footnote, endnote, or other note found in the
	  source document. This element may be used for encoding notes
	  <soCalled>inline</soCalled> at the point of reference (such
	  as where a superscript number appears), as in the Alger Hiss
	  example below. In the case of conversion from OCR and from
	  some born-digital source documents, this will require manual
	  intervention to move the text of the note to the place of
	  reference.</p>
	  <p>Alternatively, the <gi>note</gi> element may encode the
	  text of the note at the point it occurs on the page or at
	  another point convenient when converting from a born-digital
	  source document, such as at the end of a text division or in
	  a special <gi>div</gi> element within <gi>back</gi>. The
	  point of reference should be encoded using a <gi>ref</gi> or
	  <gi>ptr</gi> element, as in <ref
	  target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#COXR">3.6
	  Simple Links and Cross-References</ref>. According to this
	  model, the first footnote reference in the Alger Hiss
	  example would be encoded as:
	  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
	    <ref xml:id="n68">68</ref>
	  </egXML>
	  and the note itself as:

		    <head>POINT VIII. BECAUSE OF UNLAWFUL SURVEILLANCE, PETITIONER'S CONVICTION SHOULD BE VACATED;
		    ALTERNATIVELY, DISCOVERY AND A HEARING SHOULD BE ORDERED.</head>
		    <p>The nature and extent of surveillance of Hiss, his
		    family and associates was not known at the time of trial by
		    the defense. Even now, with the release of some of the govern&#xAD;
		    ment documents concerning FBI investigative techniques regarding
		    Hiss, the full extent of surveillance -- wiretapping, mail open&#xAD;
		    ings, mail covers, physical surveillance, and other intrusive
		    techniques -- is still not 'clear. Nevertheless, it is apparent
		    that information gathered through the exploitation of unlawful
		    wiretaps and other illegal surveillance was used at trial and
		    consequently the conviction must be reversed. Alternatively,
		    further discovery and a hearing is essential to a fair deter&#xAD;
		    mination regarding these issues.</p>

		    <p>FBI surveillance of Hiss began in earnest in 1941 with 
		    the institution of a mail cover on his incoming correspondence
		    at his home in connection with an FBI investigation of possible
		    Hatch Act violations. CN Ex. 98A. Another mail cover was placed

		    <pb n="114" facs="00000002.tif"/>
		    on the Hiss mail in 1945, and at the same time the FBI obtained
		    toll call records from the Hiss residence Telephone for the
		    years 1943 and 1944 as well. CN Ex. 99. In September, 1945,
		    the FBI intercepted telegrams to Hiss as well. CN Ex. 100.</p>

		    <p>In late November, 1945, FBI surveillance of the Hiss
		    residence in Washington, D.C., escalated. For the third time,
		    a mail cover was instituted beginning on November 28, 1945,
		    which was continued at least until 1946. CN Ex. 101 at p. 70;
		    CN Ex. 102. Continuous physical surveillance of Hiss was begun
		    as well. CN Ex. 101 at p. 72. Although this twenty-four-hour
		    surveillance was discontinued on December 14, 1945, physical
		    surveillance was conducted frequently at various times until
		    September, 1947.

		    <note place="bottom" anchored="true" n="68">Also before 1947, 
		    a letter from Priscilla Hiss addressed
		    to her son, Timothy Hobson, was intercepted and its contents
		    read. CN Ex. 100A at p. 167. In approximately March, 1947,
		    a letter from a Michael Greenberg addressed to petitioner re&#xAD;
		    garding an application for employment with the United Nations
		    was also intercepted, in a manner not revealed by the docu&#xAD;
		    ments. CN Ex. 100B</note>

		    CN Ex. 102; CN Ex. 103.</p>

		    <p>The most intrusive invasion of petitioner's rights

		    <pb n="115" facs="00000003.tif"/>
		    occurred from December 13, 1945 until the Hisses moved from
		    Washington, D.C. to New York City on September 13, 1947. A
		    "technical surveillance," -- a wiretap -- was placed on the Hiss
		    telephone at their residence on P Street-in Washington, D.C.
		    The logs of this surveillance constitute twenty-nine volumes
		    of FBI serials and are roughly 2,500 pages in length, in which
		    an enormous amount of information concerning the Hisses' per&#xAD;
		    sonal lives, relationships with friends and associates, and
		    habits is recorded.</p>

		    <p>The wiretap was installed following FBI Director Hoover's
		    application to the Attorney General for authorization,

		    <note place="bottom" anchored="true" n="69">Hoover's initial request was answered by a note reques&#xAD;
		    ting information on Hiss. CN Ex. 104. Additional information
		    was furnished by letter dated November 30, 1945. CN Ex. 105.</note>

		    although no written authorization appears in the documents released to
		    Hiss. The purpose of the application was to gather information
		    regarding Hiss' alleged contacts with Soviet espionage agents and
		    communists in government service, general allegations which had
		    been made by Elizabeth Bentley and Chambers.</p>

	    <remarks>
	      <p>Particularly where cataloguing is likely to be based
	      on the content of the header, it is advisable to use a
	      generally recognized name authority file to supply the
	      content for this element. The attributes <att>key</att>
	      or <att>ref</att> may also be used to reference
	      canonical information about the author(s) intended from
	      any appropriate authority, such as a library catalogue
	      or online resource.</p>
	      <p>In the case of a broadcast, use this element for the
	      name of the company or network responsible for making
	      the broadcast.</p>
	      <p>Where an author is unknown or unspecified, this
	      element may contain text such as
	      <mentioned>Unknown</mentioned> or
	      <mentioned>Anonymous</mentioned>. When the appropriate
	      TEI modules are in use, it may also contain detailed
	      tagging of the names used for people, organizations or
	      places, in particular where multiple names are
	      given.</p>

	      interest that are not covered by these elements, our

	      more paragraphs to follow the special-purpose elements),
	      this recommendation will likely change accordingly.</p>
